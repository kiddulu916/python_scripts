# Shipping Calculator
#
# A simple python script to calculate shipping cost base on the weight of your package
# and compare the cost to find which would be the cheapest.
#
# Shipping cost are fixed in the script and can easily be altered to fit any local areas 
# shipping prices or different companies shipping costs.
#
# To execute the script you will need python 3 installed and in the terminal run:
# 
# python3 shipping_calc.py
#
# Then just enter the weight of your package and the script will give you the pricing 
# for Ground, Premuim Ground, and Drone shipping costs and which will be 
# the cheapest option for you.
#
# To change the shipping costs, open the shipping_calc.py file in your favorite text editor 
# and follow the comments and edit the various values to match the shipping cost of your area 
# or company your shipping with.
#
# I will be making an updated version to eliminate the need of editting the script yourself and 
# have the script ask for those variables when its ran, but for now this will work.
